# Convert Latex to Python code

We fine-tuned a Salesforce/CodeT5p-770 on a 35k dataset and gain an accuracy of 74% on test data scoring 6th position. We applied Lora and post quanitization to speeding up
the inference and training. Moreover we also applied post processing in order to fix some common indentation issues

## Space to test out our model inference
